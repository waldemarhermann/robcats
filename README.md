# About

This is a project that displays a list of cats, which can be searched and filtered by name. The project makes use of a React component structure, with each component serving a specific purpose. 
The App component serves as the container for the overall application, and it manages the state of the list of cats and the search field value. 
The SearchBox component provides a search field that allows the user to filter the list of cats by name. The CardList component displays the list of cats, using a Card component for each individual cat. 
The Scroll component provides a scrollable container for the list of cats, and the ErrorBoundry component provides error handling for the list of cats.
